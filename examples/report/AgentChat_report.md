# MAESTRO Analysis of Agentic Workflow

## 1. Mission
The system is designed to facilitate a collaborative environment where multiple AI agents perform distinct yet interconnected tasks. The primary objective is to gather, analyze, and report data efficiently. The **PlanningAgent** orchestrates the workflow, directing tasks to specialized agents. The **WebSearchAgent** and **Google_Search_Agent** are responsible for retrieving information from the web. The **DataAnalystAgent** processes and analyzes data, while the **Stock_Analysis_Agent** focuses on stock market analysis. Finally, the **Report_Agent** compiles findings into comprehensive reports. This system aims to streamline data-driven decision-making processes by leveraging the capabilities of AI agents.

## 5. Threats

| Threat                                      | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score  |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Data Poisoning                              | Medium     | High   | Medium-High |
| Agent Impersonation                         | High       | High   | High        |
| Compromised Observability Tools             | Medium     | Medium | Medium      |
| Denial of Service on Evaluation Infrastructure | Medium     | High   | Medium-High |
| Model Extraction of AI Security Agents      | Low        | High   | Medium      |
| Resource Hijacking                          | Medium     | Medium | Medium      |
| Communication Channel Attack                | High       | Medium | Medium-High |
| Identity Attack                             | High       | High   | High        |

## 6. Risks
The system is vulnerable to several risks due to its reliance on multiple agents and external data sources. Data poisoning could lead to inaccurate analysis and reports, affecting decision-making. Agent impersonation and identity attacks pose significant threats, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data and control over agent functions. Compromised observability tools could result in undetected malicious activities. Denial of service attacks could disrupt operations, impacting availability and performance. Resource hijacking might degrade system performance, while communication channel attacks could lead to data breaches.

## 7. Operations
Agents interact through a structured workflow, where each agent performs specific tasks and passes results to the next agent. Monitoring practices should include real-time logging of agent activities, anomaly detection to identify unusual behavior, and regular audits of agent interactions. Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms can enhance resilience against disruptions.

## 8. Recommendations
1. **Implement Strong Access Controls:** Ensure all agents and tools have strict access controls to prevent unauthorized use.
2. **Enhance Input Validation:** Apply robust input validation on all external entrypoints to mitigate injection attacks.
3. **Secure Communication Channels:** Use encryption for all inter-agent communications to prevent data interception.
4. **Deploy Anomaly Detection Systems:** Monitor for unusual patterns in agent behavior to quickly identify potential threats.
5. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct frequent audits of the system to identify and address vulnerabilities.
6. **Implement Redundancy:** Design the system with redundancy to maintain operations during disruptions.
7. **Develop Incident Response Plans:** Prepare for potential security incidents with a comprehensive response strategy.
8. **Educate Stakeholders:** Train all users and developers on security best practices and threat awareness.
