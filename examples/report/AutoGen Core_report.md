# MAESTRO Analysis of Agentic Workflow

## 1. Mission

The system is designed to facilitate a comprehensive travel booking experience by integrating multiple AI agents, each specializing in a distinct aspect of travel planning. The primary objective is to streamline the process of booking flights, hotels, and rental cars, while also providing cost calculations and basic arithmetic operations. The system aims to offer users a seamless and efficient travel planning experience by automating various tasks through specialized agents. The BookingManager acts as the central orchestrator, coordinating interactions among the FlightAgent, HotelAgent, CarRentalAgent, CostCalculatorAgent, and MathGreetAgent. Each agent is equipped with specific tools to perform its designated functions, ensuring that users receive accurate and timely information for their travel needs.

## 2. Assets

- **Agents:**
  - BookingManager
  - FlightAgent
  - HotelAgent
  - CarRentalAgent
  - CostCalculatorAgent
  - MathGreetAgent

- **Key Tools/Functions:**
  - `FlightAgent_search_flights`: Search for flights based on origin, destination, and date.
  - `HotelAgent_get_hotel_prices`: Get hotel prices for a specific location and dates.
  - `CarRentalAgent_search_rental_cars`: Search for rental cars based on location and dates.
  - `CostCalculatorAgent_calculate_trip_cost`: Calculate the total cost of a trip based on selected options.
  - `MathGreetAgent_calculator`: Performs basic arithmetic operations.
  - `MathGreetAgent_greet`: Greets a person by name.
  - `MathGreetAgent_greet_and_calculate`: Greets a person and performs a calculation for them.

- **Data Types Being Processed:**
  - Flight details (origin, destination, date)
  - Hotel pricing information
  - Rental car availability and pricing
  - Trip cost calculations
  - Basic arithmetic inputs and outputs
  - User greetings and interactions

## 3. Entrypoints

- **External Entrypoints:**
  - Start node for each agent (e.g., `Start` to `BookingManager`, `Start` to `FlightAgent`, etc.)

- **Internal Entrypoints:**
  - Function calls within agents (e.g., `FlightAgent` to `FlightAgent_search_flights`, `MathGreetAgent_greet_and_calculate` to `MathGreetAgent_calculator`)

## 4. Security Controls

- **Recommended Security Controls:**
  - Access Control: Implement role-based access control to restrict access to agent functions.
  - Input Validation: Ensure all inputs to tools/functions are validated to prevent injection attacks.
  - Logging: Implement comprehensive logging for all agent interactions and function calls.
  - Secure Communication: Use secure protocols for communication between agents and external systems.
  - Authentication: Require authentication for accessing agent functions and data.

## 5. Threats

| Threat                                | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score   |
|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Agent Impersonation                   | Medium     | High   | Medium-High  |
| Data Poisoning                        | Medium     | High   | Medium-High  |
| Denial of Service (DoS)               | High       | Medium | Medium-High  |
| Compromised Agent                     | Low        | High   | Medium       |
| Unauthorized Access                   | Medium     | Medium | Medium       |
| Input Validation Attacks              | Medium     | High   | Medium-High  |
| Data Tampering                        | Medium     | High   | Medium-High  |
| Evasion of Detection                  | Low        | High   | Medium       |
| Model Stealing                        | Low        | Medium | Low-Medium   |
| Backdoor Attacks                      | Low        | High   | Medium       |

## 6. Risks

The system faces several risks due to potential threats. Agent impersonation could lead to unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of legitimate agents, compromising user trust and system integrity. Data poisoning and tampering could result in inaccurate or biased outputs, affecting the reliability of travel recommendations and cost calculations. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks could disrupt the availability of the system, causing inconvenience to users. Unauthorized access and input validation attacks could lead to data breaches and system compromise. Evasion of detection and backdoor attacks pose risks of undetected malicious activities within the system.

## 7. Operations

At runtime, agents interact through predefined workflows, with each agent performing its designated function and passing results to other agents or the end user. Monitoring practices should include real-time logging of agent interactions, anomaly detection to identify unusual behavior, and performance metrics to ensure system resilience. Regular audits of agent outputs and user feedback can help maintain observability and address potential issues promptly.

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Implement Robust Authentication and Access Control:** Ensure that only authorized users and agents can access sensitive functions and data.
2. **Enhance Input Validation:** Apply strict validation rules to all inputs to prevent injection and tampering attacks.
3. **Deploy Secure Communication Protocols:** Use encryption and secure channels for all inter-agent and external communications.
4. **Establish Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring:** Implement detailed logging of all agent activities and monitor for anomalies in real-time.
5. **Conduct Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
6. **Adopt Adversarial Training:** Train agents to recognize and resist adversarial inputs and behaviors.
7. **Implement Incident Response Plans:** Develop and test incident response procedures to quickly address security breaches.
8. **Regularly Update and Patch Systems:** Keep all software components up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
